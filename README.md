# Human Action Recognition (HAR)
This project aim to do video Human Action Recognition with AI.

# Solutions
Two major tools are proposed in each branch.

### CNN/RNN
We have made a model using Convolutional Neural Network and Recurent Neural Network where we achieved 61.2% top1 accuracy.

### CLIP
The second solution is using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training. We obtained 74.29% top1 accuracy with this one.

# Dataset
We have used the Kinetics 700 dataset but we have selected only 12 different labels to train our models wich are :

"applauding","cleaning toilet","doing nails","opening bottle (not wine)","petting cat","pillow fight","smoking","playing guitar","washing dishes","playing cards","stretching arm","vacuuming floor"

# Use
These versions are what have been used for the project :
Google Colab
tensorflow: 2.11.0
Python: 3.8.10
